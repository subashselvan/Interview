    <h4>Q1. Dot NET Core Overview?</h4>
    <div class="secondIndent">.NET Core is a new version of .NET Framework, which is a free, open-source,
        general-purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft. It is a cross-platform framework that runs on
        Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

        .NET Core Framework can be used to build different types of applications such as mobile, desktop, web, cloud,
        IoT, machine learning, microservices, game, etc.

        .NET Core is written from scratch to make it modular, lightweight, fast, and cross-platform Framework.In this
        way, the .NET Core application speed up the performance, reduce the memory footprint and becomes easy to
        maintain.</div>

    <h4>Q2. Dot NET Core Characteristics</h4>
    <div><b>Open-source Framework:</b> .NET Core is an open-source framework maintained by Microsoft and
        available on GitHub<br>
        <b>Cross-platform:</b> .NET Core runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. There are different
        runtime for
        each operating system that executes the code and generates the same output.<br>

        <b>Consistent across Architectures:</b> Execute the code with the same behavior in different instruction set
        architectures, including x64, x86, and ARM.<br>

        <b>Wide-range of Applications:</b> Various types of applications can be developed and run on .NET Core platform
        such as
        mobile, desktop, web, cloud, IoT, machine learning, microservices, game, etc.<br>

        <b>Supports Multiple Languages:</b> You can use C#, F#, and Visual Basic programming languages to develop .NET
        Core
        applications. You can use your favorite IDE, including Visual Studio 2017/2019, Visual Studio Code, Sublime
        Text, Vim, etc.<br>

        <b>Modular Architecture:</b> .NET Core supports modular architecture approach using NuGet packages. There are
        different
        NuGet packages for various features that can be added to the .NET Core project as needed. Even the .NET Core
        library is provided as a NuGet package.

        This way, it reduces the memory footprint, speeds up the performance, and easy to maintain.<br>

        <b>CLI Tools:</b> .NET Core includes CLI tools (Command-line interface) for development and
        continuous-integration.<br>

        <b>Flexible Deployment:</b> .NET Core application can be deployed user-wide or system-wide or with Docker
        Containers.<br>

        <b>Compatibility:</b> Compatible with .NET Framework and Mono APIs by using .NET Standard specification<br>
    </div>

    <h4>Q3. Dot NET Core Composition?</h4>
    <div class="firstIndent">The .NET Core Framework composed of the following parts:</div>
    <img src="./../img/dotnet-core-components.png" width="300" height="300" style="margin-left: 50px; display: block;">
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>CLI Tools:</b> A set of tooling for development and deployment.<br>
        <b>Roslyn:</b> Language compiler for C# and Visual Basic<br>
        <b>CoreFX:</b> Set of framework libraries.<br>
        <b>CoreCLR:</b> A JIT based CLR (Command Language Runtime).</div>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h4>Q4. Why ASP.NET Core?</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <b>Supports Multiple Platforms:</b> ASP.NET Core applications can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac. So you don't
        need to build different apps for different platforms using different frameworks.<br>
        <b>Fast:</b> ASP.NET Core no longer depends on System.Web.dll for browser-server communication. ASP.NET Core
        allows us to include packages that we need for our application. This reduces the request pipeline and improves
        performance and scalability.<br>
        <b>IoC Container:</b> It includes the built-in IoC container for automatic dependency injection which makes it
        maintainable and testable.<br>
        <b>Integration with Modern UI Frameworks:</b> It allows you to use and manage modern UI frameworks such as
        AngularJS, ReactJS, Umber, Bootstrap, etc. using Bower (a package manager for the web).<br>
        <b>Hosting:</b> ASP.NET Core web application can be hosted on multiple platforms with any web server such as
        IIS, Apache etc. It is not dependent only on IIS as a standard .NET Framework.<br>
        <b>Code Sharing:</b> It allows you to build a class library that can be used with other .NET frameworks such as
        .NET Framework 4.x or Mono. Thus a single code base can be shared across frameworks.<br>
        <b>Side-by-Side App Versioning:</b> ASP.NET Core runs on .NET Core, which supports the simultaneous running of
        multiple versions of applications.<br>
        <b>Smaller Deployment Footprint:</b> ASP.NET Core application runs on .NET Core, which is smaller than the full
        .NET Framework. So, the application which uses only a part of .NET CoreFX will have a smaller deployment size.
        This reduces the deployment footprint.<br>

    <h4>Q5. ASP.NET Core - wwwroot Folder?</h4>
    <div class="secondIndent">By default, the wwwroot folder in the ASP.NET Core project is treated as a web root
        folder. Static files can be stored in any folder under the web root and accessed with a relative path to that
        root.

        In the standard ASP.NET application, static files can be served from the root folder of an application or any
        other folder under it. This has been changed in ASP.NET Core. Now, only those files that are in the web root -
        wwwroot folder can be served over an http request. All other files are blocked and cannot be served by default.

        Generally, there should be separate folders for the different types of static files such as JavaScript, CSS,
        Images, library scripts etc. in the wwwroot folder as shown below.</div>
    <hr class="my-4">

    <h4>Q6. ASP.NET Core - Program.cs?</h4>
    <div class="secondIndent">ASP.NET Core web application is actually a console project which starts executing from the
        entry point public static void Main() in Program class where we can create a host for the web application.</div>
